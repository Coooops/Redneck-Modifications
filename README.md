# Redneck-Modifications

Note: This repository contains the resources made & wroten by Coops, please read Legal what can you do with them and what is the point of this rep!

Redneck-Modifications reposity was founded on 18 July 2021. Since the time we have been uploading all resources what we have modified from others or fully made by myself - Coops, I do also have other reposities like custom fivem framework ( if it's not on my profile, that means it is still under build or deleted ) mostly I like free resources and after closing up my other public fivem servers I decided to make people's life much easier by making custom scripts public, what are actually being sold / or not even exisiting on black internet. Enjoy all freedom and do not go over limits.

# What We Have and What is Coming Soon?

- Esx_Taxijob_V2 + 3 ( Now available )
- Esx_Government_V1 ( Available Soon! )
- Esx_PoliceJob_V2 ( Available In Future )
- Esx_ambulanceJob_V4 ( Available in Future )

- Custom Framework for Fivem ( Under Build, will be free )
- And More :)

# Other

Redneck Modifications is fully accessible for everyone and is free, like I said im not making any paid stuff for github, please do not sell or share anything without Coops permission. And if you think that I am the Redneck officially, then wrong, im not developer of any fivem vehicles ( maybe in future ) and all original Redneck's services are paid, so huge difference. Second thing that he is fully covered and hard to find his actual company name, Im mostly naming my company as Redneck Leaks, due it sounds good :V

If you're not in the mood to read, we have youtube named Redneck Leaks what has some preview of things what are here for downloading!

# Legal

Redneck Leaks / Modifications Legal is listed on every resource you download from me, if there is something else or missing, means its already leaked / can be virus from some other badass!
